of the nature of quantum systems. Reversibility is created by creating gates that have the same number of inputs as outputs, so that the inputs can be created from whatever the outputs are. Reversibility allows for garbage collection discussed later on, it is also required by some implementations and it allows for thermodynamical neutral systems. That is is say system that do not generate heat. The two standard quantum gates that are used in most cases and are easily reversible are the CNot and the CCNot gate. The CNot gate takes two qubits as inputs, if the first is a one, then it performs a NOT operation on the second qubit flipping its value it then returns both qubits. The CCNot gate takes three inputs and performs an AND operation between the first two, if the results of that operation is one, then it performs a not operation on the third qubit and returns all three qubits. The truth Table for the CCnot can be seen on the left. These two gates are the minimum required to perform any operation. There are other gates that can be created and are sometimes useful but they are not required and all logic or math operations can be performed by the Cnot and CCNot gates.
