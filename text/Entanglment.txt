	The basic mechanics of quantum computing are, in general, the same as classical computing. Computations are performed by qubits, and logical operations are still performed with boolean logic gates. The similarities end with the vast differences in implementation. There are many possible methods of creating these quantum systems the exact implementations will be discussed later. Each of these different implementations uses different manipulations of qubits and implementations of quantum gates in order to perform the same functions.A qubit is always a particle, whether it be a neutral atom, an ion or an electron, which always has some manipulable physical property that can be used to store information in binary as either a zero or a one just like a classical bit. The quantum gates that are implemented are always the CNot gate and the CCnot gate. Using these, every mathe
