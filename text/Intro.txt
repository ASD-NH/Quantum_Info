Welcome to Quantum computinng

Quantum computational processing, or quantum computing as it is often called is defined as computational procession done with or made possible by the field of quantum mechanics. This differs from classical computing, which is based on the field of classical physics. Quantum computing is a rapidly growing scientific field with large amounts of research, across many various different subfields. Quantum computers have the possibility to be many time faster than current computers and would allow for processes that were previously thought to be impossible. This means that computing may have the power to revolutionize many parts of life.
