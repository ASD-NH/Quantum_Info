In order to give a proper overview of the field of quantum computing this paper is broken in three major parts. First the theoretical perfect quantum computer.This part discusses how quantum computers differ from classical computers and what their advantages are as well how they perform computations. The second major part discusses current real world implementations of quantum computers, this will cover the various different methods of creating a quantum computer and where they currently stand. The third and final part discusses the next step and current research being done to improve quantum computers
