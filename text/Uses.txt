Another example of the power of quantum computing is in the implementation of Shor’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is a factoring algorithm. To factor large numbers in classical computing the number is simply divided by every number before it, this means that the time to factor large numbers increases exponentially with the number of digits. However using Shor’s algorithm and quantum computers, large numbers can be factored with only a linear increase in time. This means that even very small and simple quantum computers are better at certain tasks than modern supercomputers. However sometimes Shor’s algorithm returns the wrong answer due quantum error, and in order to correct this we need quantum error correction.
