One of the most important and powerful features of quantum computers is that they can use the quantum mechanical property of superposition. In a classical computer a bit is either 1 or 0, leading to four possible states in a 2 bit system. However, a qubit (quantum bit) can be both 1 and 0 in a combined state of superposition. This allows for the four possibility sytem with one qubit. Because of this a quantum computer of n bits is equivalent to a classical computer of 2n bits. A quantum computer of comparable power to a classical computer would be much smaller and generate far less heat.
